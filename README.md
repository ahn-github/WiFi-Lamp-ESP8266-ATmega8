# WiFi-Lamp-ESP8266-ATmega8
C code Atmel Studio project
I hope this project is easy to understand and modify it.
Or just upload ATmega8_ESP8266_LAMP.hex and enjoy.
I downloaded android app from here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=udpcontroller.nomal
ESP8266 creates access point with SSID: "CyberPunk LAMP" and PASSWORD: "beworthy"
To control server you should send string "on" or "ON" to turn on lamp and  "off" or "OFF" to turn it off.
Strings should be sent to socket with IP. 192.168.4.1 and port 80 (192.168.4.1:80)
